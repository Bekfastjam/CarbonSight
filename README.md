# CarbonSight – Real-Time CO₂ Emissions Tracker

**CarbonSight** is a simple tool for tracking and visualizing real-time CO₂ emissions data. It helps users become more aware of their carbon footprint and understand how daily activities impact the environment.

## Features

- Live tracking of CO₂ emissions from various sources
- Simple data input for transportation, electricity, and other activities
- Instant calculation and visualization of total emissions
- Easy-to-read dashboard or command-line output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:

   ```
   python carbonsight.py
   ```

### How It Works

- Enter your daily activities (e.g., kilometers driven, kWh used, flights taken).
- The tool calculates your total CO₂ emissions in real time.
- See a summary of your emissions and compare activities.

## Example

```
Enter kilometers driven today: 15
Enter electricity used (kWh): 8
Enter number of short flights: 0

Your estimated CO₂ emissions today: 7.4 kg
- Car: 3.3 kg
- Electricity: 4.1 kg
```

## Customization

- Add more emission sources (e.g., food, heating) in the script.
- Adjust emission factors as needed for your region.
